# Starknet ERC20 Token Deployer

An easy-to-install and deploy tool for deploying an ERC20 token on the Starknet network. &nbsp; \
With a simple installation and deployment process, you can quickly create and customize your ERC20 token on Starknet.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
## 🛠️Prerequisites🛠️

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following installed:

- Bash: Linux Ubuntu > 22.04 | Windows - [WSL2](https://www.sitepoint.com/wsl2) | macOS - [Change settings](https://alvinwanjala.com/blog/set-bash-default-macos-shell)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.11.0 or higher)
- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)&nbsp; 

\
``
``
Additionally, you'll need a deployed wallet on seploia(testnet) on either [ArgentX](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Braavos](https://braavos.app/) for a test deployment. &nbsp;

After you choose a wallet, change the network to sepolia(testnet): &nbsp; \
In Braavos just go to wallet setting and click on networks and change to sepolia. &nbsp; \
For ArgentX you can use [How to change network for ArgentX guide.](https://docs.argent.xyz/argent-wallets/argent-x/adding-custom-rpcs) &nbsp; 

To deploy a test token and to deploy the wallet on the blockchain you'll need some ETH in your wallet, you can use [blast's free faucet](https://blastapi.io/faucets/starknet-sepolia-eth). &nbsp; 

After your wallet is funded you can proceed to set it up on chain (deploy): &nbsp; \

## First Time Deployment🚀 🚀 🚀 

Once the installation is complete, run the following command to deploy the test ERC20 token:

```bash
cd Starknet-ERC20-Deployer && npm run firstDeploy
```

You will be prompted to enter your private key and the address to deploy your token. &nbsp; \
Make sure your wallet is already deployed on sepolia with either [ArgentX](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Braavos](https://braavos.xyz/).

&nbsp;
## Customization📊

After the first test deployment, you can customize your ERC20 token by editing the `.env` file that was saved in your Starknet-ERC20-Deployer folder. &nbsp; \
Modify parameters such as token name, symbol, initial supply, etc., to tailor the deployment to your needs. &nbsp; \
Then to deploy your customized token just run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

&nbsp;
